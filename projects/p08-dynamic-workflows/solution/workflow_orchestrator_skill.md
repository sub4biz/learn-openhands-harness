# Deep Research Workflow Skill

Use this skill when a user asks for broad research where the right angles are not fully known until the question is inspected.

## When to use a dynamic workflow

Use a workflow when all of these are true:

- The question has 3 to 6 independent research angles.
- Parallel research can improve coverage or wall-clock time.
- Claims can be verified through sources, citations, or explicit stale-risk labels.
- A final synthesis step can combine findings without hiding uncertainty.

Do not use a workflow when the question is tiny, purely subjective, compliance-critical, or better represented by deterministic application code.

## Workflow shape

1. Read the user question and choose 4 to 6 research angles.
2. Use `web_searcher` sub-agents to research each angle.
3. Use `fact_checker` sub-agents to verify source quality, stale-risk claims, unsupported claims, and overbroad conclusions.
4. Use `synthesizer` to write the final report and workflow summary.
5. Preserve uncertainty from the verification step.

## Hard limits

- Do not read `.env` or print secret values.
- Prefer primary sources and cite URLs or exact document names.
- If web browsing or current search is unavailable, say so explicitly.
- Use at most 6 research angles.
- Do not invent sources.
- Do not convert unsupported claims into confident prose.

## Expected artifacts

Write these files under `.harness_workflow/dynamic/`:

- `DEEP_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`: the synthesized report.
- `WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md`: the chosen angles, sub-agents used, evidence limits, and dynamic decisions.

## Suggested workflow API usage

Use the workflow tool's map/reduce pattern:

```python
research = await wf.map_agents(
    items=research_angles,
    prompt="Research this angle with primary sources: {item}",
    subagent_type="web_searcher",
)

verified = await wf.map_agents(
    items=research,
    prompt="Verify source quality and mark stale-risk claims: {item}",
    subagent_type="fact_checker",
)

final_report = await wf.reduce_agent(
    items=verified,
    prompt="Synthesize into DEEP_RESEARCH_REPORT.md and WORKFLOW_SUMMARY.md.",
    subagent_type="synthesizer",
)
```

The model may choose the research angles, but it may not ignore the artifact contract or verification requirements.
